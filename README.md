===========

This is a cursor-built application that uses a chat interface, and embedded SQL storage
to run a gig app for caregivers and their patients.
As an exercise, it started off as Prolog.
But LLMs are way more familiar with SQL, and I may come back to Prolog on a different kind of app that makes more sense.
